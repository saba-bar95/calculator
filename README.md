### Project: Calculator

### This project is done as part of the [Odin course](https://www.theodinproject.com/dashboard)

I had a great chance to use what I had learned about JavaScript's fundamentals in this project.

A calculator that can be used on a keyboard and has all the necessary functionality. Using the relevant keys, you can input numbers and operators. You can also cancel and remove activities by using the corresponding "backspace" and "d" keys.
